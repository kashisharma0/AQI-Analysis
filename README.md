## AQI-Analysis

This project analyzes air quality data to identify pollution trends, detect outliers, and highlight the most and least polluted cities and states.

# Dataset
- The dataset contains air quality readings for various pollutants across different cities and states.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

# How to Run
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main script: `python air_quality_analysis.py`

# Insights
- Top Polluted Cities: The top 10 cities with the highest average pollutant levels were identified.
- Outlier Detection: Pollution data contained some extreme outliers, especially in maximum pollutant values.
- Geospatial Analysis: Least polluted areas were highlighted, showing regions with better air quality.
